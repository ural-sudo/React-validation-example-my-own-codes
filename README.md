# React-validation-example-my-own-codes


Hı guys,

This is the basic validation control app.

If you want to download and extract this project  dont forget install all packages before starting project. Via ' npm install'.

Codes that ı wrote here are already wrotten before but this is the another version. this is the my codes.

I hope codes are useful for you.

Actually these codes  can write more shortly but you can learn the events and their control  logic easliy like this.
